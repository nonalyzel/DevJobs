About Wholesale Investor

Wholesale Investor is a leading private investment platform connecting innovative private, pre-IPO, and listed companies with a global network of high-net-worth and professional investors. Our mission is to streamline the capital-raising process and create unparalleled opportunities for both companies and investors.

We are entering an exciting phase of growth and are looking for a talented developer to join our modern, flexible team and help build the future of our platform.


The Opportunity

We are seeking a forward-thinking and motivated Full Stack NodeJS Developer to take ownership of our core online platform. This is a pivotal role where you will not only drive the development of new features but also champion the integration of modern AI tools to accelerate our development lifecycle.

You will be the key technical mind behind our platform's evolution, working closely with our internal team to deliver a seamless and powerful experience for our users. This role offers significant autonomy, a choice of how and where you work, and the chance to make a tangible impact on a product at the heart of the investment ecosystem.


What You'll Be Doing

Lead the Transition: Manage a smooth and comprehensive handover of the existing platform from the current developer.

Own the Codebase: Dive deep into our technology stack (NodeJS, React, Firebase) to quickly become the subject matter expert

Innovate with AI: Spearhead the migration of our codebase from Bitbucket to GitHub to unlock the full potential of AI-powered development tools like GitHub Copilot and other accelerators.

Collaborate and Create: Liaise directly with internal stakeholders to define, design, and deliver an exceptional look and feel for new platform features.

End-to-End Development: Own the entire feature lifecycle, from initial concept and coding through to robust scenario testing and deployment.

Manage Environments: Take responsibility for our staging and production environments on Google Cloud and Firebase, ensuring platform stability, performance, and security.

What You'll Bring (Core Skills & Experience)

Proven experience as a Full Stack Developer, with a strong emphasis on Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend.

Hands-on experience developing, deploying, and scaling web applications on Google Firebase, including services like Realtime Database (RTDB).

A genuine interest and demonstrated ability to leverage AI development tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT for code) to enhance productivity and code quality.

Solid understanding of NoSQL databases and experience with data warehousing solutions like Google BigQuery.

Familiarity with Git version control and CI/CD principles (we use Bitbucket, transitioning to GitHub).

Experience integrating and working with analytics platforms such as GA4 and Mixpanel.

Excellent communication and problem-solving skills, with a proactive attitude and the ability to thrive in an autonomous, remote-friendly environment.


Why You'll Love Working at Wholesale Investor

Ultimate Flexibility: We embrace a modern work culture. This role can be fully remote from anywhere in Australia or a hybrid arrangement based out of our North Sydney office.

Flexible Terms: We offer both Full-Time (FTE) and Part-Time (PTE) contract terms to suit your lifestyle and availability.

Direct Impact: Your work will directly shape a key platform in Australia's investment landscape.

Tech-Forward Culture: Be at the forefront of development by utilising cutting-edge AI tools and a modern cloud-native stack.

Collaborative Team: Join a passionate and supportive team dedicated to achieving our mission, with a great office hub in North Sydney for those who wish to use it.
